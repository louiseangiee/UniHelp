### About UniHelp
UniHelp is a platform where prospective students can gain admission insights and can track their application progress for various universities. They can also communicate with other students and learn more about the universities and the admission process through the forum. Current students are also highly encouraged to help prospective students by submitting their admission results to this site, which will help us generate better admission statistics for other students. UniHelp is currently available for local universities in Singapore, namely NTU, NUS, and SMU. We hope that UniHelp will be able to help students who are facing the tough university admission process.
