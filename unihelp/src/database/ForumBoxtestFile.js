She always sits at the back row with another girl and sometimes I hear her laughing and I wish I could talk to her to make her laugh too :(, any advice on how to ask her out? I would approach her after class but she’s always surrounded by friends and rushing off. Should I ask her for lunch? But she always has some breakfast (sometimes I see teh o from koufu, corn, or buns). Help a lost guy out please….",
